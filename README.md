# Sata

*Simple cross-platform image processing toolkit*

![Build](https://github.com/muqiuhan/sata/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)

</div>

## Introduction

This is an image processing toolkit written in Scala, which will contain many image processing programs based on opencv and yolo, etc.

## List
- Detect target objects in images

## Usage

This project uses opencv 4.8.1, So you need to make sure that `opencv-481.jar` is in your system's classpath, Or you can specify its path, for example:
```shell
-Djava.library.path=/usr/local/share/java/opencv4/
```

For developers, you need to create a new directory `lib` in the project root, Then put `opencv-481.jar` into it. This is for integration with IDE.

### Detect target objects in images
```scala
val input = object_detection.input.Input("Image Path")
val processor = object_detection
  .processor
  .Processor(
    input.input(),
    "Your ONNX model path",
    input.transform.letterbox
  )

val output = object_detection.output.Output(processor.process())

class Run extends sata.Sata[String, Mat, Mat, Unit](input, processor, output):
  override def run(): Unit = output.output()

Run().run()
```
